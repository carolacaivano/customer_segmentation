This project focuses on customer segmentation to support more effective and targeted marketing campaigns. Using a dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vishakhdapat/customer-segmentation-clustering), that contains demographic and purchasing behavior features such as age, income, total spend, and purchase channels were analyzed. The data was preprocessed and scaled before applying K-Means clustering to identify distinct customer segments. Each cluster was interpreted and labeled based on behavioral and economic patterns. The resulting segments provide actionable insights for personalized marketing strategies and improved customer engagement.
